### the mind of ra the wolf
is a digital representation of my mind at specific times in life

i have philosopher personality, and sometimes i express myself through writing, creating a life-llng philosophical diary.

i have my own unique thoughts, ideas, concepts. Those concepts build up to make my own language, or at least patterns ( a 'pattern language'?) Anyway, it's worth keeping my own view of the world in tact.

### notes
this part of the readme serves as a simple version of GitHub's projects, issues, and wiki features, so keep those features off.

todo:
- it's starts by porting my old blog (Wordpress!!! lolll... yiikes!!)
- fix https issue
- this is one repo that should have an appropriate license...
- add The Mind of Ra crowd-funding writings
