the mind of ra the wolf

is a digital representation of my mind at specific times in life

i have philosopher personality, and sometimes i express myself through writing, creating a life-llng philosophical diary.

i have my own unique thoughts, ideas, concepts. Those concepts build up to make my own language, or at least patterns ( a 'pattern language'?) Anyway, it's worth keeping my own view of the world in tact.
